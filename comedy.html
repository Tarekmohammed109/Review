    Kumail Nanjiani(Kumail Nanjiani) is a Pakistani cab driver and an aspiring comedian who is instantly drawn to American student Emily Gordon(Zoe Kazan) who he bumps into at a bar in Chicago. But, his parents want him to be a good Muslim and marry a Pakistani. And therein lies the conflict or at least some of it …
    </span>
    </p>
    <p class="p">
    <span class = "bolder">The Big Sick Review: </span><span class = "normal">
    Michael Showalter’s drama is based on the real-life romantic track of the protagonist (Kumail who plays himself) and the gori he ultimately marries. And the script (co-written by Kumail and Emily) has many laugh-out-loud moments. Their initial dates, where the couple talks of keeping it casual are fun to watch. As is the scene in which you’re introduced to Kumail’s family. The banter at Nanjianis’ suburban Chicago home with his parents Azmat (Anupam Kher) and Sharmeen (Zenobia Shroff), is delightful. Like most immigrants, they’ve made America their home, but Pakistan still resides in their hearts. Typically they encourage their son to pray to Allah and even organize a daily parade of eligible young Pakistani-American women for him to choose his bride from.

    Kumail who fears that he’ll be osctracised doesn’t tell his parents about his American girlfriend. Nor does he give in to Emily’s request of having dinner with her parents—Terry (Ray Romano) and Beth (Holly Hunter) who are visiting from North Carolina. This is when Emily decides to call off their relationship. But fate wills otherwise. When she lands up in hospital, Kumail who takes charge of the situation also comes to terms with how deeply he cares for her.

    Self-deprecatory humour keeps the mood alive through and through. Be it a mention of the ISIS or Terry’s wish to talk with a Muslim about the 9/11 attacks, everything provides a `good’ laugh.

    Kumail’s cowardice in not telling his parents that he is dating a non-Muslim and his initial terse interactions with Emily’s parents in the hospital are both funny and emotional.

    As far as performances go, Ray and Holly lead the way; Anupam Kher is adept and Kumail with his mostly-comic expressions passes muster. The film lacks the vitality of My Big Fat Greek Wedding and other such romcoms. It could also do with a 10-minute shorter run. But there is no taking away from the fact that this smart comedy is an ideal monsoon getaway.

    Steven Soderbergh’s ‘Logan Lucky’ is an American heist comedy film. It focuses on three siblings who plan to rob the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina.
    </span>
    </p>
    <p class="p">
    <span class = "bolder">LOGAN LUCKY REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    Steven Soderbergh retired from filmmaking in 2013, claiming that he had lost interest in the industry. The director behind the 'Ocean's Trilogy' – the iconic heist series – decided to come out of retirement and make another entry in the same genre, but this time at the other end of the glamor spectrum. If the sophisticated crew of Ocean's had swag, then this ragtag group has rustic charm, and loads of it. Set in West Virginia, there's nothing fancy about any of them, or their methods. But Soderbergh's years of experience with handling an assorted cast hasn't wasted away over the years. He empowers each actor with enough material to showcase their range of skills and to a large extent, they do not disappoint. 

Tatum & Driver play two siblings carrying some family baggage due to unfortunate events. They both imbibe their characters with a subtle sibling tension under the surface but are undeniably brothers in arms. Their sister Mellie Logan, played by Riley Keough, is a strong presence even with her limited screen time. There are a lot of smaller parts featuring a talented set of actors like Hilary Swank and Seth MacFarlane who might make you wonder what they’re doing in this film at certain points, but clearly, everyone’s having a great time playing this assorted bunch of endearing oddities. That’s certainly the case for Daniel Craig, who seems to have taken up this film as a palate cleanser of sorts. Before he wears the bespoke suit again, and gets back all his fancy toys as the spy extraordinaire, he has to make do as a petty criminal with a penchant for crude bombs. Instead, Craig walks a fine line between being a tightly wound manic genius, and an eccentric loose cannon waiting to blow up. It’s a thrill to watch him at work as the wild card.

Which is also a way to describe ‘Logan Lucky’ as a film. It’s unpredictable, with some unforeseen twists and turns but with its heart intact. While the last act feels a bit drawn out, especially with the rushed introduction of a particular character, the majority of the film plays out smoothly and there’s hardly a lull in the quirky humor and suspense. Even if it doesn't raise the stakes of the genre, there’s enough potential to turn this funny and smartly written caper into another entertaining Soderbergh franchise.

    <span class = "bolder">BABY DRIVER REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    It is a simple sign of cinematic triumph if, throughout a movie, you are bobbing your head and tapping your foot to the rhythms of the scenes.Baby Driver is just that. A triumph. For its sheer originality in execution and a cast of cool-cats capable of charming your socks off.

An unexpectedly delicious cocktail of two genres, musical and heist-movie, it starts with Baby (Elgort) in a high-speed chase, skidding between trucks and swerving in and out of tunnels to save bank robber Buddy (Hamm) and his friends from the police. They’re all puppets in the hands of Doctor (Spacey), who never uses the same crew twice except for his lucky Baby.

But little does Doc know that his good luck charm has started getting some bad feelings about the business, especially after meeting Debora (James). Doctor plans one last loot but this is where Baby shifts gears and goes off-track.

This is a musical unlike any other. People are neither dressed in costume, nor do they break out in song. The music comes from lyrical lines in the dialogue; it comes from the rhythm of machine guns firing bullets; it comes from a bundle of cash as someone brushes its edges. Steven Price’s smartly produced score and Bill Pope’s captivating camerawork result in a movie that is no less than a new car: slick, sexy and smooth.

And this car backfires very few times. The dialogue-heavy second act tries to keep up the momentum with repartee instead of revving engines, but fails. Kevin Spacey delivers a performance that is just too reminiscent of his Frank Underwood from House Of Cards.

Spacey stays in familiar territory but Elgort, as Baby, takes the leap from teen-movie Romeo to action-movie Rambo effortlessly. It’s a riot to watch Foxx and Hamm as tough guys with tattoos who are constantly bickering. James’s inherent niceness is almost essential to a movie this morally skewed.

Baby Driver is a great experiment in the heist-movie genre and with director Edgar Wright behind the wheel, you’re sure to have a smooth ride.

    Set in 2002, a teenage girl discovers herself through love, relationships and the city of Sacramento, California.

    </p>
    <p class="p">
    <span class = "bolder">Lady Bird Review: </span><span class = "normal">
    It’s evident that Greta Gerwig takes a lot of inspiration from her own life in ‘Lady Bird’. In her solo directorial debut based on her original screenplay, she draws from these experiences to make the film genuine and honest. There are familiar setups of the ‘coming-of-age’ genre – a classic one sees lead character Christine, who goes by the name Lady Bird, falling in love with a guy from school only to end up heartbroken when she catches him cheating on her. But the way the scenario plays out is far from typical. Just as life is full of surprises, Lady Bird gets to experience a lot of them along the way, taking us along for the ride.

The realism is hammered down through all the performances, mainly by Saoirse Ronan as Christine/ Lady Bird. Ronan captures the angst, confusion and determination of a teenager on a journey of self-discovery. She is perfectly cast as the temperamental, restless girl who begins to understand what it means to look beyond yourself. Lady Bird believes she is better off away from Sacramento, forgetting that her parents are financially struggling to make ends meet. This sets up the plot for a lot of friction with her mother, leading to the most prominent angle – the mother-daughter relationship. Even though the narrative revolves around Ronan, it’s Laurie Metcalf who often steals the show as Marion who is, in essence, the adult version of Lady Bird. Equally strong-willed to the point of being obstinate, Metcalf is hilarious, yet firm as a mother who pokes holes in her daughter’s self-obsessive bubble.

Besides the two main characters, Gerwig infuses a lot of personality into all the supporting roles, making each one of them essential to the plot. Although they might seem to be forgetful, Gerwig ensures that their parts are not merely decorative, and far from stereotypical. The credit goes to her writing skills and ability to present a collection of memories from someone’s teenage years without being pretentious, or melodramatic for the sake of cheap laughs or tears. Just like the protagonist, ‘Lady Bird’ is awkwardly funny yet bittersweet, making it one of Hollywood’s most original and refreshingly honest films about growing up.

    <span class = "bolder">THE BOSS BABY REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    Must animated movies border on the bizarre?

The Boss Baby will test your threshold for quirky stories. In the realm of animation, nothing is too unreal: talking cars? Sure. Lost fish? Let’s give it a sequel. Emotions with their own emotions? Worthy of an Oscar. Add to that a baby who is a cunning corporate official, talks in pie-charts and is working relentlessly towards ridding the world of… puppies. See, bizarre!

Tim (voiced by Miles Bakshi) watches in shock as his evil baby brother (voiced by Alec Baldwin) fools his parents (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow) into believing that he’s the adorable new addition to the family, while slyly planning a coup against the pet company that they work for. Puppies, baby’s research shows, are taking over the world with their cuteness and making babies obsolete.

The film opens with a hilarious montage that shows where babies come from: a baby-manufacturing factory with assembly lines and everything. Most of them are assigned to a family, and some who aren’t cute enough are sent to work at this factory’s headquarters. All of this is prefaced by the fact that our protagonist Tim has a very vivid imagination. The whole movie could very well be an active fantasy of his. But whether it is real or not is left to the viewer.

The writing is mostly fresh, sometimes infused with dry wit and will tickle you. There is some physical comedy, a lot of toilet humour and (thankfully uncensored) baby bottoms. The story itself turns into quite a cliche with an evil villain (voiced by Steve Buscemi) and a little boy with a saviour complex. Towards the end, there is some blatant emotional manipulation, but it isn’t too bothersome.

This isn’t one of those films that are unnecessarily 3D; the animation is impressive and enhances the experience.

Give it a shot, the storytelling isn’t strong enough to make you weep like a baby, but it will occasionally make you giggle like one.
