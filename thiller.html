   In 1979, when the opening title for ‘Alien’ slowly emerged on screen along with its instantly memorable theme, viewers had no clue what to expect. They eventually discovered what the vicious extra-terrestrial was capable of, and collective screams were heard loud and clear. Almost a decade later, an entire army of these creatures would wreak havoc in a sequel that ramped up the action and scares. Since then, the series has regrettably descended into generic drivel in an obvious attempt to capitalize on its popularity. Under the reins of Ridley Scott – who directed the very first film – ‘Prometheus’ showed some signs of a possible revival, harking back to the origins of the iconic space beast.Unsurprisingly, Scott attempts to ride that momentum by combining some of the essential and successful ingredients of the franchise, but forgets to dwell on the most vital aspect that made ‘Alien’ and ‘Aliens’ extraordinary. Audiences were emotionally invested in both those respective crews, which made their outcomes (and inevitable demises) jarring and memorable. Although teased in the trailers, there’s little of that seen here, and distinct personalities are only given to a couple of members who are then, predictably put through the wringer. The most crucial character is played by Michael Fassbender, as the connective tissue between ‘Prometheus’ and ‘Covenant’. He delivers a typically striking performance, and his ability to adopt unique characteristics, accents and mannerisms is delightful to witness. Katherine Waterston as Daniels does her best to channelize Ellen Ripley, although the former is nowhere as compelling as that quintessential female protagonist played by Sigourney Weaver. The most surprising performance however, comes from Danny McBride who sheds his comedic roots to dramatic effect.

Sadly, their efforts are wasted in a story filled with plot holes and frustrating choices made by some of the crew. Although the film presents some interesting concepts regarding the survival of one species over another, it doesn’t change the fact that ‘Covenant’ is by-and-large, a rehash of several elements that made the series work in the first place, and does little to propel it into compelling territory. Clearly there’s not much left to explore in this ‘Alien’ world and fans would be better off revisiting the first two classics to find their screams again.

    <span class = "bolder">DUNKIRK REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
   Christopher Nolan is a director who puts a lot of thought into writing and directing his films. He's a visual storyteller who cares dearly about the narrative structure he painstakingly arranges on the screen while treating his audience with substantial intelligence. For years, he’s broken new ground in cinema by tackling complex concepts with multiple layers that unravel with repeat viewings. So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that ‘Dunkirk’ is another Nolan film that will reveal new aspects a second or even third time around.At the outset, this story is relatively straightforward – almost 4 lakh allied soldiers are stranded on a beach, surrounded by land and being picked off slowly by air bombers. They need to be evacuated by sea, but there aren’t many ships to ferry them off. It’s an absolutely harrowing predicament to be in, and Nolan captures the fear, anxiety, strength and bravery of those involved in equal measure. He does not politicise or glorify the notion of war, instead choosing to portray it for what it is – a complex game of survival, with little room for heroics. What’s astounding is his ability to do so with minimal dialogue. Arguably, any of the actors could be easily replaced and the movie wouldn’t be hampered. Each soldier, officer, pilot, general and captain has his own significant role to play but in the absence of emotional pandering, the entire event itself turns into the lead character.

His decision to completely abstain from CGI, and opting for practical effects instead, makes every gunshot, explosion and dogfight feel extremely real and potent. This is further accentuated by an unnerving musical score by Hans Zimmer that only adds to the nonstop tension. These elements combine to make ‘Dunkirk’ a purely visceral experience, especially in IMAX. While it is not for the average moviegoer – if you’re looking for a fun and mindless action flick there are other options around – it is the first real contender for ‘Best Picture', and a number of other technical awards. If nothing else, it is yet another landmark achievement by one of the most important and skilled storytellers in the present generation of filmmaking.

    It is a simple sign of cinematic triumph if, throughout a movie, you are bobbing your head and tapping your foot to the rhythms of the scenes.Baby Driver is just that. A triumph. For its sheer originality in execution and a cast of cool-cats capable of charming your socks off.

An unexpectedly delicious cocktail of two genres, musical and heist-movie, it starts with Baby (Elgort) in a high-speed chase, skidding between trucks and swerving in and out of tunnels to save bank robber Buddy (Hamm) and his friends from the police. They’re all puppets in the hands of Doctor (Spacey), who never uses the same crew twice except for his lucky Baby.

But little does Doc know that his good luck charm has started getting some bad feelings about the business, especially after meeting Debora (James). Doctor plans one last loot but this is where Baby shifts gears and goes off-track.

This is a musical unlike any other. People are neither dressed in costume, nor do they break out in song. The music comes from lyrical lines in the dialogue; it comes from the rhythm of machine guns firing bullets; it comes from a bundle of cash as someone brushes its edges. Steven Price’s smartly produced score and Bill Pope’s captivating camerawork result in a movie that is no less than a new car: slick, sexy and smooth.

And this car backfires very few times. The dialogue-heavy second act tries to keep up the momentum with repartee instead of revving engines, but fails. Kevin Spacey delivers a performance that is just too reminiscent of his Frank Underwood from House Of Cards.

Spacey stays in familiar territory but Elgort, as Baby, takes the leap from teen-movie Romeo to action-movie Rambo effortlessly. It’s a riot to watch Foxx and Hamm as tough guys with tattoos who are constantly bickering. James’s inherent niceness is almost essential to a movie this morally skewed.

Baby Driver is a great experiment in the heist-movie genre and with director Edgar Wright behind the wheel, you’re sure to have a smooth ride.

    <span class = "bolder">BLADE RUNNER 2049 REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
   It would be easy to accuse Hollywood of making another massive cash grab by revisiting Ridley Scott’s sci-fi cult classic ‘Blade Runner’. 35 years after the original in 1982, what other reason would there be for going back to that unique world? Turns out that it’s the one that made the most sense – to tell a great story helmed by a masterful storyteller.Denis Villeneuve is fast approaching the upper echelons of modern-day directors, and his vision here is so well-defined and executed that it wouldn’t be a far stretch to say he has already arrived. This is not just a love-letter from a fan; Villeneuve displays his confidence in picking up such a beloved story, builds on it, and throws us some more polarizing plot points that would be argued over in the years to come. He also skillfully combines the key elements of filmmaking – the most obvious one being the absolutely stunning cinematography by Roger Deakins, who has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards so far and makes a no-brainer case for his 14th here. The soundtrack was another vital element in the original that was pathbreaking, and maestro Hans Zimmer does justice to those iconic themes by Vangelis.

Villeneuve also has a talented ensemble to work with – Ryan Gosling has hardly featured in a bad role so far, and his work here is also stellar. There are smaller roles played by Sylvia Hoeks, Robin Wright and Mackenzie Davis that manage to become memorable. Ana de Armas, in particular, seems to be an actress to watch out for, while Jared Leto is predictably unsettling. Reviving another beloved character he is known for – Harrison Ford is completely invested in this role and his chemistry with Gosling is essential to some key plot points that make ‘Blade Runner 2049’ even more significant as a sequel. In fact, it goes a step further to enhance the original, making all the questions raised there even more relevant. This justifies an elongated runtime that would get tedious if it wasn’t so gorgeous to look at. Admittedly, this will completely go over your head if you haven’t watched the original but if you liked it, you simply cannot afford to miss ‘Blade Runner 2049’.

    Must animated movies border on the bizarre?

The Boss Baby will test your threshold for quirky stories. In the realm of animation, nothing is too unreal: talking cars? Sure. Lost fish? Let’s give it a sequel. Emotions with their own emotions? Worthy of an Oscar. Add to that a baby who is a cunning corporate official, talks in pie-charts and is working relentlessly towards ridding the world of… puppies. See, bizarre!

Tim (voiced by Miles Bakshi) watches in shock as his evil baby brother (voiced by Alec Baldwin) fools his parents (voiced by Jimmy Kimmel and Lisa Kudrow) into believing that he’s the adorable new addition to the family, while slyly planning a coup against the pet company that they work for. Puppies, baby’s research shows, are taking over the world with their cuteness and making babies obsolete.

The film opens with a hilarious montage that shows where babies come from: a baby-manufacturing factory with assembly lines and everything. Most of them are assigned to a family, and some who aren’t cute enough are sent to work at this factory’s headquarters. All of this is prefaced by the fact that our protagonist Tim has a very vivid imagination. The whole movie could very well be an active fantasy of his. But whether it is real or not is left to the viewer.

The writing is mostly fresh, sometimes infused with dry wit and will tickle you. There is some physical comedy, a lot of toilet humour and (thankfully uncensored) baby bottoms. The story itself turns into quite a cliche with an evil villain (voiced by Steve Buscemi) and a little boy with a saviour complex. Towards the end, there is some blatant emotional manipulation, but it isn’t too bothersome.

This isn’t one of those films that are unnecessarily 3D; the animation is impressive and enhances the experience.

Give it a shot, the storytelling isn’t strong enough to make you weep like a baby, but it will occasionally make you giggle like one.
