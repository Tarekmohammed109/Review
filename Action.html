    <span class = "bolder">TOMB RAIDER REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    In the early 2000’s, Angelina Jolie played Lara Croft in a couple of films based on the video-game character who fuelled the fantasies of gaming nerds everywhere. Based on the success of the game’s reboot in 2013, the time seemed appropriate to focus on Lara Croft’s abilities as a female adventurer, rather than her status as a sex symbol. To say that Alicia Vikander had big boots to fill would be an understatement. Then again, Vikander is more than capable as an actress, with an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (‘Danish Girl’) in her belt. She takes on the physically demanding role in this live-action revision of the franchise with ease, erasing any trace of her on-screen predecessor.
    This version of Lara Croft is emotionally vulnerable and devoid of superhuman abilities. She needs to use her intellect and courage to overcome the challenges ahead of her. Vikander keeps us invested enough through Lara Croft’s transformation from a naive, hesitant girl to a confident woman who isn’t afraid of taking risks. But in establishing her roots, the film resorts to some of the clichéd tropes of an origin tale. As a result, the plot is often predictable and logically convenient to push the story forward. There’s also the problem of the generic villain Vogel, played by Walton Goggins, who doesn’t feel sufficiently threatening to be taken seriously.
    On the other hand, Dominic West as Lord Richard Croft brings in enough emotional resonance as Lara’s father to make her motivations well-justified as their scenes together are essential to the plot. Although the clunky screenplay results in uneven pacing issues that make for a sloppy watch, the action is compelling enough to see you through. If only it didn’t rely so heavily on snappy editing, it would be even more thrilling. These choices by director Roar Uthaug hold the movie back from being an intense experience. But ‘Tomb Raider’ does enough to reignite the franchise onscreen by giving its protagonist a timely and relevant overhaul to confidently launch Alicia Vikander as this generation’s Lara Croft.

    <span class = "bolder">FAST & FURIOUS 8 REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    Eight movies into 'Fast and Furious', one would think the testosterone-fueled concept of speeding cars that defy the laws of physics would begin to start losing steam. But Vin Diesel with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Jason Statham and crew manage to keep our eyes glued to the screen just for the sheer spectacle of complete mayhem that ensues.
    The franchise does try to do things a bit differently this time around. Since Dominic Toretto is virtually untouchable behind the wheel, turning him against his 'family' and leaving his crew to fend for themselves, considerably raises the stakes on a personal front. With the addition of versatile actress Charlize Theron to the mix as a hacker extraordinaire, Diesel even gets to flex some of his acting muscles. Though it's a shame that Theron doesn't trade blows with the boys, she's a heartless, cold and calculating villain who proves to be more than a challenge. The rest of the proceedings are standard alpha-male fare, though Jason Statham as Deckard and The Rock as Hobbs prefer to exchange a barrage of verbal insults at each other, saving their fists for other unfortunate souls. There’s a surprising cameo from a revered British actress who lights up the screen in the few scenes she’s in – clearly having fun in a movie that doesn’t demand more from her accomplished acting skills.
    There’s much to enjoy when cars are flying around the screen, even if logic takes flight with them. Some of the sequences are absolutely preposterous but make for such a dazzling display of destruction, they allow you to appreciate the sheer audacity of the filmmakers to even conjure them up! Traditional for big-budget films today, the plot leaves room for yet another outing, although at this point one wonders how much gas is left in the tank of this franchise.

    <span class = "bolder">JUSTICE LEAGUE REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    Amidst all the superhero movie mayhem we’ve vividly experienced for over a decade, it’s not a stretch to say that no comic book event has been as highly anticipated as seeing the Justice League come together on film. Sure, the build-up has been shaky along the way, but fans of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) saw a distinct glimmer of hope with ‘Wonder Woman’ earlier this year. It seemed like some crucial lessons had been learned, albeit the hard way, and set into motion. But production woes dogged ‘Justice League’, striking fear in the hearts of fans – would this be another major misstep from the DC stable?

Let’s get to the good stuff first – this is definitely a highly enjoyable comic book film! Even though the marketing desperately tried to showcase its difference in tone from the rest of the DCEU, most of the chuckle & gasp-worthy scenes land home on the big screen despite being devoid of the surprise element. We’re familiar enough with the big three – Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman, so Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, and Henry Cavill are all allowed to shine through and make their presence felt. Even the relatively new additions – Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg, fit well into this world and the actors are well-cast. Thankfully, the whole team has ample chemistry with each other, and while the story is derivative with a disposable villain, it focuses on quickly dazzling from one scene to the next.

Sadly, it’s also hard to look past the production issues because they are quite evident at some points. Some chunks seem to be missing from the story, and although it doesn’t come across as incoherent, it feels tremendously rushed along with evidently last-minute CGI patchwork. Clearly, the DCEU is building towards bigger, and hopefully better things, but the course-correction feel is glaringly obvious. That aside, it commits to a distinct goosebump-inducing, fandom-pleasing tonality, one that will be well-appreciated down the line. Replace your skeptical lens with 3D glasses, and cheer along with your childhood heroes; ‘Justice League’ is made for the fans, and if you’re one, you’ll have a lot of fun.

    Set in 2029, the film begins at a time when mutants are on the verge of extinction, Charles Xavier’s (Sir Patrick Stewart) school doesn’t exist anymore and he along with Logan (Hugh Jackman) lead an austere life hiding near the Mexican border before getting embroiled in a life and death situation.

    <span class = "bolder">LOGAN REVIEW : </span><span class = "normal">
    After 17 years of playing one of the most popular characters in the X-Men franchise, Hugh Jackman (Wolverine/ Logan) naturally has a lot riding on his hunky shoulders in Logan — the third and last installment in the solo Wolverine series. Don’t expect to see the X-Men in all their glory because the characters have aged and been through the fires. Xavier’s declining mental and physical health (he’s in his 90s now) and Logan’s ageing body almost make us feel sorry for the two characters. While Logan earns a living by driving a limousine, getting drunk and getting into fights, Xavier's disintegrating mind compels him to stay sedated in order to keep his colossal psychic powers under control. The film has a lot of gory scenes — there’s plenty of bloodshed thanks to Logan’s notorious adamantium claws — so be prepared. But what shines through the action are the number of emotional moments between the lead characters, making it the most moving film of the franchise so far.



Debutant Laura Kinney/ X-23 (Dafne Keen) at 11, will give tough competition to other actresses her age. With skills and claws just like Logan’s, the feisty youngster is being hunted down by a group of merciless troublemakers, who’re led by Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook). Logan and Xavier unwillingly become a part of the plan to save Laura and the trio embark on a dangerous adventure, which forms the crux of the film. It’s interesting to see how the relationship between the three characters plays out and how despite initial resistance from Logan, the trio become an unlikely family.

I was fully invested in the movie. I knew it was my last chance: Hugh Jackman


What makes the movie different from other superhero flicks is the way director James Mangold has dealt with the subject — without hesitating to show his ageing superheroes go into battle while they fight their own inner demons. Also, the highlight of the film is Jackman’s compelling performance. He knows it is his swan song and he exits with a flourish — an unforgettable end to a remarkable odyssey. You don’t have to be a comic superhero fan to enjoy this movie — watch it for the outstanding performances by Jackman, Stewart and Keen. This one’s a gripping finale to Wolverine’s indomitable journey.

    Indestructible assassin John Wick is pulled out of his retirement yet again to fulfill a blood oath he’d made to the Italian mafia.

    <span class = "bolder">JOHN WICK CHAPTER 2 REVIEW: </span><span class = "normal">
    The John Wick franchise is what would happen if Woody Allen wrote action-thrillers. Just like Allen’s slice-of-life movies with high-strung characters in familiar setting, these movies are self-aware, unapologetic and true to their genre. Only here, bullet-speed dialogue is replaced by bullet-speed… well, bullets.

Sticking to the USP of the first John Wick film - a one-line plot facilitating a hundred different ways to kill - director Chad Stahelski serves up the second chapter in the protagonist’s life. Wick (Keanu Reeves), who had come out of retirement to avenge the death of his dog and the theft of his car, is approached by Santino D’Antonio (Riccardo Scamarcio) whom he owes a favour. Wick is coaxed into doing one last job, but eventually realizes that he’ll be the one staring down the barrel of a gun.

The entire appeal of the movie lies in its beautifully choreographed action sequences. Wick appears to have five lives like in a video game and engages in an almost non-stop shooting spree with bodies piling up by the roadside, in hotel lobbies, at concert venues and at subway stations. A particularly cool scene has Wick, wounded, walking through a crowded place as he realizes that everyone around him has a contract to kill him, and springs into action taking them down one by one. There’s even a mirrored-room sequence which is supposed to be an homage to Enter The Dragon.

Reeves is as stoic and monosyllabic as ever; Common has a great extended cameo; Ruby Rose is mostly playing another variation of her Orange Is The New Black character - a deadly girl of few words.
